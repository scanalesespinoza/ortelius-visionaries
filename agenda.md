## 8:30 Implementing a Microservice Architecture using a Domain Driven Design
Presented by Aditi Agarwal and Hosted by Garima Bajpai

In this session we will define why a domain driven design (DDD) is important to building a shared service architecture. DDD is not new and has been a core methodology for defining ‘problem’ spaces to organize shared libraries. This session will give a basic definition of DDD and demonstrate how Ortelius helps facilitate this methodology through Domains.

## 9:15 Observability vs. Visibility - what is the difference?
Presented by Sacha Wharton and Hosted by Karamjot Singh

Observability - the process of tracing transactions between services on a single cluster - is an important aspect of microservices. But knowing how your microservices relate to one another across clusters in a logical view is another important data point. Visibility into microservices provides a proactive method for tracking the ‘logical’ application versions as their underlying components are updated. This presentation will show you how Ortelius creates the visibility across all clusters.

## 10:00 Pitfalls - Monolithic practice in a microservice architecture
Presented by Sergio Canales and Hosted by Saim Safdar

If you are getting started with microservices in a Kubernetes environment, be careful to avoid falling back on monolithic constructs in a microservice environment. Saim and Sergio will explore the topics and point out the pitfalls you should watch for.

## 10:45 Know Your Blast Radius
Presented by Munirat Sulaimon & Temitope Bimbo Babatola and Hosted by Atul Tiwari

So you feel like you’re flying blind sometimes? That is because you may not have the data to show you how a single microservice update will impact a specific cluster, and the applications. In this presentation, you will see how Ortelius manages your impact analysis and blast radius of all microservices.

## 11:30 Ortelius and GitOps (Panel) - the Road Ahead
Panelist: Steve Taylor, Christopher Hicks, Brad McCoy, Sergio Canales
Hosted by Tracy Ragan

As Ortelius evolves, it will support a GitOps model. This panel discussion will cover design concepts for the Ortelius GitOps approach. This project will begin in the early fall.

## 12:15 - Closing statements from Steve Taylor.
